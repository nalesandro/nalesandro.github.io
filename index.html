        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I'm <s>Corey</s> Nick.</p>
        <p>While I have very few original ideas of my own, I'm pretty good at recognizing others'. Sometimes I <a href="https://twitter.com/nick_alesandro">tweet</a> about it.  Lol jk I almost never do.</p>
        <p>Most recently I worked with the team that built <a href="https://thegroundwork.com/">The Groundwork</a>; you might have heard about our work for <a href="https://qz.com/520652/groundwork-eric-schmidt-startup-working-for-hillary-clinton-campaign/"> Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>
        <p>I watch <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>, have totally heard of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXV28GtXeo">Chaos Gorilla & Kong</a>, and complained during most outages.</p>
        <p>I've been doing this for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nalesandro">a while</a> and would love to chat.</p>
