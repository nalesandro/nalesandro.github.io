Deadlines will be updated for team members that will join shortly before the deadline passes.

### READ THIS CAREFULLY

- **Flight budget per person $1500** (this includes hotel stay if long layover) - Book **BEFORE May 1st 2018**
- Before booking your flights, make sure your passport expires after 2019-03-01. 
- Check layover options thoroughly. Ensure that you do not need a transit visa for any layovers. If you do need a transit visa, please wait to book your flights until you have cleared it with Brittany or Chloe. 
- Check flights through apps/sites like [Hopper](https://www.hopper.com/) (great app), [Momondo](https://www.momondo.com/), [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com) or [Hipmunk](https://www.hipmunk.com) 
- Setup flight alerts for your route to get updates on pricing
- When you’ve found a flight, try to book with the airline itself 
- Be creative! i.e: Jamie H will be flying out of Chicago instead of Minneapolis and saved $800
- If you strike out finding a flight within normal ranges, please contact travel@gitlab.com for us to help you with flight arrangements **before April 1st 2018**

### Safety information as mentioned in the form
To make sure everyone understands these safety measures we’re sending out a form to be signed by the whole team. 
Please understand these guidelines:
Read these safety advisory pages carefully and don’t take the information lightly.

- Due to safety reasons we discourage everyone from leaving the hotel after dark, even in groups.
- Do not go out on your own, under any circumstances, day or night
- Always notify the (Summit planning) team when you leave the hotel on your own in a group (by a DM on Slack)<br>

- https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/safety-and-security 
- https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/south-africa.html 
- Main concerns are for the townships
- Exercise caution with taxis especially at night (do not use mini-van taxi’s at all), ideally only Taxify & Uber. 
Also at the airport ignore any individuals wanting to give you a tour/ taxi ride.
- Avoid alley’s or walking in quiet streets alone. Cape Town is a lovely location to walk in, but also makes for easy targets to mug from a cellphone and wallet/ backpack. 
- Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area.
- Do not display cash and valuables. This includes your phone, camera and jewelry!
- Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
- Always carry a copy of your passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. 
- Being aware of your surroundings is extremely important to ensure your personal safety.
- Don’t leave any valuables in your room, make sure to use the safe provided in the room and keep your bags locked when you leave the room. 
- Be vigilant at all times and make sure to create awareness if you think you are being followed.
- In an emergency, should you need serious medical care, insist on a Private hospital (travel insurance is important and South Africa’s public hospitals are not a good option at all).
