### Our Little Walrus is Ready to Fly.
After months under wraps, the project known internally and affectionately as "Walrus" is ready for public release as a [major new feature called Groundwork Collections](https://thegroundwork.com/features/collections)!  

You can use Collections to define, collect and securely store any type of data on The Groundwork servers, then filter and retrieve it for display on your website or restrict it to internal-only use.

In essence, Collections gives you your very own database, spun up and ready for use without having to worry about security, scale, access, tuning, or any of the other headaches that make DBA such an attractive career choice.  And like a database, the possibilities for its use are basically endless. 

### There's Levels to it (You and I Know).
OK, we recognize that "possibilities for its use are basically endless" is neither particularly humble nor practically helpful.  So here are some practical examples from our own experience and our early customers' usage.  Like all Groundwork technology, you can approach it at various levels, from elementary to intricate.

#### Level 1:  Acquire Supporters.
Pretty much everyone wants to collect emails to grow and contact their supporter base.  So every Groundwork customer gets a prefab Supporter Collection with the most-commonly used fields, as well as utm tracking, arbitrary metadata tagging and customizable auroresponder.  Just go to our [Supporter Signup Block page](https://developer.thegroundwork.com/tools/blocks/supporter-signups/) to create a signup form for your website.

And remember, Supporters flow automatically into [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) via our Mailchimp integration and into [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) via our Salesforce integration.

#### Level 2:  Tweak Your Supporters.
Let's say you want to collect your Supporters' birth dates so you can send them a birthday card every year.  Good idea, wish we thought of it!  But we didn't and our prefab Supporter collection doesn't have that field.  No problem though - you can add any field you want via our Manage Collections page.

#### Level 3:  Engage Your Supporters.
How about sending a poll to Supporters via email or social media, asking them to pick the issue most important to them? Or asking for personal stories around those important issues?  Or obtaining unfiltered grassroots feedback on your organizations direction and strategy?  Other systems let you do all this, but that's a problem - they're _other systems_ - important information about your community is spread around various free and paid accounts.  

With Collections, you can define any quiz, poll, petition, feedback form, or whatever you like.  The Groundwork ensures that all responses are linked to the Supporter who submitted them so you have a complete picture of engagement.

Collections also allow you to moderate records for public consumption.  For example if you wanted to collect real-world stories from the community and display them on your website, we'd suggest your site only display stories that have been reviewed and marked "Approved" by someone in your organization.

#### Level 4:  Go Beyond Supporters.
We've seen that Collections are a powerful way to engage and track Supporters. However since you can store _anything_ in a Collection, customers have used them to branch out beyond simply collecting emails.  For example, you can create a public directory of community events, rallies, or groups (to name a few), with those items stored in a Collection and made searchable from your website.  Collections even automatically geocodes records so your site visitors can search for example for "rallies within 20 miles of me this weekend".

You can add records to a public directory yourself or safely moderate submissions from your community.  The Collection moderation workflow allows you to expand your reach by soliciting data from the public while still retaining control over what's displayed to the public.

### Knowledge is Power.
We hope this post was a gentle introduction to Collections and the myriad ways you might use them; we can't wait to be surprised by the creative ways you _will_ use them!  There's a lot of technical horsepower under the hood, so if you're curious about how it all works, see our [comprehensive API documentation](https://developer.thegroundwork.com/api/#collections).  Or, as always...
