# A positive vision for "community lunch"

### Positive intro, suggest a carrot vs stick. Let's make everybody want to do it.
Good job making it forward-looking.  No need to fuck with peoples livelihood.  If we can make a model work that works for everyone, then companies may choose to voluntarily follow suit with their existing cafeterias and/or catering programs.  Let's built a better carrot.

### Personal perspective on why go out
My perspective as someone who works in a SF office at 4th and Brannon... I get out, get a walk, get some sun/fog, talk to people.  One time I even helped someone out and it brightened my day (dog story).  The more people I interact with the better.  Also, JFC its San Francisco - there are a ton of places to eat, with world-class variety at every price point. Sometimes when you go out with co-workers, you learn about them as people.

### Establish common ground on appealing principles, make everyone win
If we can agree that it's a positive thing for people to get out of the office for a bit AND that supporting local business is a good thing AND that variety in your diet is a good thing, in addition to what companies already know, which is that feeding their workers is almost a requirement, then we're on the same page. And maybe we can take advantage of some of the tech made right here in the city.

So the key is cooperation between employees, employers, city, and businesses to make it a win-win-win-win, achieving the goals. 

### Suggested course of action
A humble suggestion
 - City: Consider the upcoming new employer projects that'll be subject to the reg
 - Pick 1 or 2 with the most promising and walkable food options (restaurants but also groceries, cafes, farmers market access)
 - Establish a working group with those businesses
 - Model out what it *wouldve* cost those businesses per employee/day to have a cafeteria 
 - Divert those funds to a voucher type program. OK this could get tricky and maybe where tech comes in. Square cash/venmo kinda thing?  Needs, um, thought.
 - Incentive: City exempts these purchases from city sales tax for some period of time (accrues to an overall benefit for local businesses, worth it).  Are takeout orders taxed tho?
 - Incentive: Businesses offer discounts to emps using the program (ehhhhh, maybe too burdensome)
 - Run the program, gather data, be prepared to make changes as the bright idea interacts with the real world
 - Then promote the model to new AND existing businesses.  Happy workers, happy businesses, more cohesive society

### Things to consider
 - Compost/trash impact
 - Subsidy for bike share
 - Rainy days?
